## [Unreleased]

## [2.6.0] - 2023-10-20

ðŸš€ Up to **115x faster** for very large SVG files

Now resvg has been upgraded from v0.29.0 to [v0.34.0](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#user-content-0340---2023-05-27), bringing with it a host of new SVG features and performance improvements.

- Support SVG2 `mask-type` property.
- Allows quadratic BÃ©zier curves: text might render slightly differently (better?). This is because TrueType fonts contain only quadratic curves and we were converting them to cubic before.

- Clipping and masking is up to 20% faster.
- Reduces the peak memory usages for SVGs with large paths (in terms of the number of segments).
- A new rendering algorithm.<br>
  When rendering [isolated groups](https://razrfalcon.github.io/notes-on-svg-parsing/isolated-groups.html),
  aka layers, we have to know the layer bounding box beforehand, which is ridiculously hard in SVG.<br>
  Previously, resvg would simply use the canvas size for all the layers.
  Meaning that to render a 10x10px layer on a 1000x1000px canvas, we would have to allocate and then blend
  a 1000x1000px layer, which is just a waste of CPU cycles.<br>
  The new rendering algorithm is able to calculate layer bounding boxes, which dramatically improves
  performance when rendering a lot of tiny layers on a large canvas.<br>
  Moreover, it makes performance more linear with a canvas size increase.<br>
  The [paris-30k.svg](https://github.com/google/forma/blob/681e8bfd348caa61aab47437e7d857764c2ce522/assets/svgs/paris-30k.svg)
  sample from [google/forma](https://github.com/google/forma) is rendered _115 times_ faster on M1 Pro now.
  From ~33760ms down to ~290ms. 5269x3593px canvas.<br>
  If we restrict the canvas to 1000x1000px, which would contain only the actual `paris-30k.svg` content,
  then we're _13 times_ faster. From ~3252ms down to ~253ms.

### Added

- feat: upgrade to usvg/resvg 0.34.0. [#268](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/268) Thanks to @zimond

## [2.5.0] - 2023-10-16

### Added

Now we can finally loading custom fonts in Wasm, including the WOFF2 format (see [playground](https://resvg-js.vercel.app/)), thanks to the high-performance `woff2-rs`.

In addition, we implemented smarter default font family fallback. the `defaultFontFamily` option can now be omitted. We'll read the font-family from the incoming fonts and set it to the default.

```html
<script src="https://unpkg.com/@resvg/resvg-wasm"></script>
<script>
  ;(async function () {
    await resvg.initWasm(fetch('https://unpkg.com/@resvg/resvg-wasm/index_bg.wasm'))

    const font = await fetch('./fonts/Pacifico-Regular.woff2')
    if (!font.ok) return

    const fontData = await font.arrayBuffer()
    const buffer = new Uint8Array(fontData)

    const opts = {
      font: {
        fontBuffers: [buffer], // New in 2.5.0, loading custom fonts.
        // defaultFontFamily: 'Pacifico', // You can omit this.
      },
    }

    const svg = '<svg> ... </svg>' // Input SVG, String or Uint8Array
    const resvgJS = new resvg.Resvg(svg, opts)
    const pngData = resvgJS.render(svg, opts) // Output PNG data, Uint8Array
    const pngBuffer = pngData.asPng()
    const svgURL = URL.createObjectURL(new Blob([pngData], { type: 'image/png' }))
    document.getElementById('output').src = svgURL
  })()
</script>
```

- feat: improve custom loaded fonts. Thanks to @yisibl [#209](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/209)
- feat: support for loading custom fonts in Wasm, via the `fontBuffers` option. Thanks to @antmelnyk [#217](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/217)
- feat: support loading WOFF2 font in Wasm. Thanks to @yisibl [#220](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/220)
- chore: Wasm uses the same logic as Node.js to find the default font family.Thanks to @yisibl [#252](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/252)

We have improved the [upstream svgtypes#14](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/svgtypes/pull/14), allow parsing of float `rgb()/rgba()` values from CSS Color 4 draft like `rgb(3.14, 110, 201)`.

- fix(deps): update rust crate svgtypes to 0.12.0. Thanks to @yisibl [#266](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/266)

### Changed

- test: fix test image timeout. [#262](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/262)

## [2.4.1] - 2023-02-15

### Fixed

- fix: the `defaultFontFamily` not working. [#208](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/208) Thanks to @yisibl

  Starting with resvg 0.28.0, the logic for font loading has [changed](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg/commit/36b0e0b928015ef0788a9d0babcbc77eaf8f34aa#diff-6d4d24ae259685abf64776b23b1c6e7af8c3a9718591d7db8d092e3b6cbb216fR684-R686), which causes the family passed in the defaultFontFamily option to not be applied.

## [2.4.0] - 2023-02-09

This is a brand new version with 2-3x faster performance. It also resolves an issue with a specific SVG causing an error, and all users are advised to upgrade to this version.

```shell
  resvg-js(Rust):
    39.6 ops/s, Â±1.72%   | fastest

  sharp:
    10.9 ops/s, Â±31.43%   | 72.47% slower

  svg2img(canvg + node-canvas):
    10.8 ops/s, Â±28.52%   | slowest, 72.73% slower
```

The upgrade will be hard due to the big changes made to upstream resvg. resvg 0.28.0 started with the removal of the ability to output SVG string, and we had to backport that functionality to a new crate: `usvg-writer`.

Eventually, we upgraded resvg for 2 successive versions, and are now at the latest 0.29.0.

### Changed

- feat: upgrade resvg/usvg to 0.28.0. [#194](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/194) Thanks to @zimond
- feat: upgrade resvg/usvg to 0.29.0. [#199](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/199) Thanks to @zimond
- chore: upgrade rust-toolchain to nightly-2023-02-01. [#199](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/199) Thanks to @yisibl
- chore: remove bench-related dependencies. [#200](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/200) Thanks to @yisibl

### Fixed

- fix: 'the previous segment must be M/L/C' error. [#204](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/204) Thanks to @yisibl

  This is a normal error thrown by resvg when parsing Path Command and has been confirmed as fixed in [resvg 0.30.0](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#fixed-8)(see [commit](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg/commit/82d77a0b54535e3c3cc514848ef17409b0a4c2b5)).

  Add a test to ensure it is now fixed.

  ```shell
  thread 'main' panicked at 'the previous segment must be M/L/C', usvg/src/pathdata.rs:219:17

  note: run with `RUST_BACKTRACE=1` environment variable to display a backtrace
  fatal runtime error: failed to initiate panic, error 5
  ```

## [2.3.1] - 2023-02-02

- feat: upgrade wasm-bindgen to 0.2.84

## [2.3.0] - 2023-02-02

- fix: update napi-rs(2.10.13) to resolve Electron 21+ create Buffer issues. [#195](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/195)

  > Electron 21 and later will have the V8 Memory Cage enabled, with implications for some native modules.
  > https://www.electronjs.org/blog/v8-memory-cage

  This means that all napi-rs-based native modules will be affected. Usually there is an error like this:

  ```bash
  UnhandledPromiseRejectionWarning: Error: Failed to create napi buffer
  ```

  Good thing napi-rs has implemented a compatible approach in the new version, thanks to [@Brooooooklyn's work](https://github.com/napi-rs/napi-rs/pull/1445).

- feat: add wasm file to exports. Thanks to @hadeeb [#186](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/186)

  This solves the problem that direct `require.resolve("@resvg/resvg-wasm/index_bg.wasm")` in tools like vite or webpack would report an error.

  ```bash
  Module not found: Package path ./index_bg.wasm is not exported from package
  /playground/node_modules/@resvg/resvg-wasm (see exports field in
  /playground/node_modules/@resvg/resvg-wasm/package.json)
  ```

  See the [Node.js documentation](https://nodejs.org/api/packages.html#package-entry-points) for details about why:

  > Existing packages introducing the "exports" field will prevent consumers of the package from using any entry points that are not defined,

- fix(ci): use zig to cross-compile armv7. [#176](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/176)

  This solves the problem of CI errors:

  ```shell
  Error: /lib/arm-linux-gnueabihf/libm.so.6: version `GLIBC_2.35' not found (required by /build/resvgjs.linux-arm-gnueabihf.node)
  ```

  Due to the GitHub Actions Ubuntu [upgrade from 20.04 to 22.04](https://github.com/actions/runner-images/issues/5490), the glibc version became 2.35. To maintain our compatibility, zig cross-compilation is now enabled to support older versions of glibc systems.

  | Distribution     | Glibc | GCC    |
  | ---------------- | ----- | ------ |
  | CentOS 7         | 2.17  | 4.8.5  |
  | Ubuntu 16.04     | 2.23  | 5.4.0  |
  | Ubuntu 18.04     | 2.27  | 7.5.0  |

  | Debian 11.4      | 2.31  | 10.2.1 |

- doc: add Node.js 18 to 'Support matrix'. [#155](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/155)

## [2.2.0] - 2022-11-18

Now resvg-js can be run natively (not Wasm) directly in Deno, this allows to get close to the performance of Node.js native addons in Deno.

```shell
deno run --unstable --allow-read --allow-write --allow-ffi example/index-deno.js
```

See [Deno Example](example/index-deno.js)

```js
import * as path from 'https://deno.land/std@0.159.0/path/mod.ts'
import { Resvg } from 'npm:@resvg/resvg-js'
const __dirname = path.dirname(path.fromFileUrl(import.meta.url))

const svg = await Deno.readFile(path.join(__dirname, './text.svg'))
const resvg = new Resvg(svg, opts)
const pngData = resvg.render()
const pngBuffer = pngData.asPng()

await Deno.writeFile(path.join(__dirname, './text-out-deno.png'), pngBuffer)
```

In addition, resvg-js can return the raw pixels data of the PNG, which can be very convenient for scenes where only pixels need to be processed.

### Added

- feat: add `.pixels` API for returning PNG pixels data ([#123](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/123)).
- chore: upgrade to resvg v0.25.0 (by @zimond in [#156](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/156)).
  - Partial `paint-order` attribute support. Markers can only be under or above the shape.
  - CSS3 `writing-mode` variants `vertical-rl` and `vertical-lr`. Thanks to @yisibl.
  - (tiny-skia) AArch64 Neon SIMD support. Up to 3x faster on Apple M1.
  - Path bbox calculation scales stroke width too. Thanks to @growler.
  - (tiny-skia) Round caps roundness. Fixes [#155](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/155).

### Changed

- build: x86_64-linux-gnu and aarch64-linux-gnu are no longer compiled using Zig. ([#165](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/125))
- doc: the `dpi` option is not the DPI in the PNG file. ([#146](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/146))
- chore: add deno example and docs. ([#154](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/154))
- feat: upgrade napi-rs to 2.10.0 and Node.js v18. ([#157](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/157))
- test: add image resolver API test case. ([#164](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/164))
- feat: remove the `infer` crate, this reduced the size of the Wasm file by about **4.3%**. ([#165](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/165))
  - Before: 1360609 bytes
  - After: **1302173 bytes**
- feat: error code UnrecognizedBuffer changed to UnsupportedImage. ([#165](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/165))

### Fixed

- fix: ignore `png` crate in `renovate.json`. (by @CGQAQ in [#161](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/161))

## [2.1.0] - 2022-07-03

### Added

- Add `imagesToResolve()` and `resolveImage()` APIs to load image URL. By @zimond in [#102](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/102)

  - Supports PNG, JPEG and GIF formats.
  - This only works for `xlink:href` starting with `http://` or `https://`.
  - See [example](example/image-url.js) for more details.

  In order to support loading image URL, we forked the rust side of resvg and made some improvements.

  Now please witness the magic moment:

  ![load image URL Demo](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2784308/168537647-6787dfc3-49b6-42bb-be5e-35ddba8072d9.png)

- Add `innerBBox()` API. By @yisibl in [#105](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/105)

  Calculate a maximum bounding box of all visible elements in this SVG. (Note: path bounding box are approx values).

- Add `getBBox()` API. By @yisibl in [#108](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/108)

  We designed it to correspond to the [`SVGGraphicsElement.getBBox()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/SVGGraphicsElement/getBBox) method in the browser.

  This is different from the `innerBBox()` API, by default it does apply transform calculations and gets the BBox with curves exactly. This works well in most use cases, the only drawback is that it does not calculate BBoxes with stroke correctly.

- Add `cropByBBox()` API. By @yisibl in [#108](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/108)

  With this API, we can crop the generated bitmap based on the BBox(bounding box).

  <img width="550" alt="cropByBBox Demo" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/2784308/177039185-5c1a8014-9e44-4c18-aae2-8f509163da56.gif">

  ```js
  const fs = require('fs')
  const { Resvg } = require('@resvg/resvg-js')
  const svg = '' // some SVG string or file.
  const resvg = new Resvg(svg)
  const innerBBox = resvg.innerBBox()
  const bbox = resvg.getBBox()

  // Crop the bitmap according to bbox,
  // The argument to the `.cropByBBox()` method accepts `bbox` or `innerBBox`.
  if (bbox) resvg.cropByBBox(bbox)
  const pngData = resvg.render()
  const pngBuffer = pngData.asPng()

  console.info('SVG BBox: ', `${bbox.width} x ${bbox.height}`)
  fs.writeFileSync('out.png', pngBuffer)
  ```

- feat: upgrade svgtypes to 0.8.1 to support [4 digits and 8 digits](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-4/#hex-notation) hex colors. By @yisibl in [#127](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/127)

### Changed

- feat: return undefined if bbox is invalid. By @zimond in [#110](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/110)
- chore: use jimp-compact instead of jimp.
- fix(deps): update rust crate napi to 2.5.0.
- fix(deps): update rust crate mimalloc-rust to 0.2.
- chore: export AR in android pipeline.
- style: rust indent changed from 2 to 4 spaces.

## [2.0.1] - 2022-05-07

### Added

- feat: add bbox related API. @zimond in [#90](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/pull/90)

  This version does not yet implement Node.js or Wasm bindings, so it is not available for now.

### Fixed

- fix: rebuild Wasm to solve the problem of not working in the browser.

## [2.0.0] - 2022-04-30

resvg-js now supports WebAssembly. ðŸŽ‰

- You can convert SVG to PNG in the browser or Web Worker
- We provide Playground for direct use: https://resvg-js.vercel.app

With WebAssembly, resvg-js gains broader cross-platform compatibility, all by loading only about 1.2MB of Wasm files. And, the API is consistent with the Node.js side.

The current version of Wasm does not support loading fonts, so please submit an issue if you have a request.

### Added

- feat: support WebAssembly(wasm32 target) via wasm-bindgen (#51)
- feat: add [WebAssembly playground](https://resvg-js.vercel.app)
- feat: upgrade resvg to 0.21.0
- feat: upgrade to napi-rs 2.1.0 (#60)
- chore: improved error message when output PNG size is 0 (#58)
- doc: add Node.js and WebAssembly usage documentation (#63)

## [2.0.0-beta.0] - 2022-04-02

The resvg-js API is now largely stable.

### Changed

- feat: `render()` result as a new class

  `render()` now no longer returns the `Buffer` directly, you need to get the buffer via the new `render().asPng()`, also added `render().width` and `render().height` to return the size of the PNG.

## [2.0.0-alpha.6] - 2022-03-20

### Changed

- chore: add libc fields on linux platform packages

  On Linux, it is not possible to tell exactly what kind of C library a native modules depends on just by os/cpu, so yarn 3.2 and cnpm added libc fields to further distinguish this case. This avoids downloading both `gnu` and `musl` packages at the same time.

  Currently only [yarn 3.2+](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/pull/3981) and [cnpm](https://github.com/cnpm/npminstall/pull/387) are supported, the npm implementation is [still under discussion](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/519).

## [2.0.0-alpha.5] - 2022-03-19

### Changed

- feat: rounding width / height, this will further improve [#61](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/61).

  Physical pixels cannot be decimal, and when SVG dimensions have decimals in them, the output PNG dimensions are rounded. This should be consistent when getting the PNG size through the width / height API.

## [2.0.0-alpha.4] - 2022-03-14

### Added

- feat: strip text features and reduce the size of the generated wasm file.
  - Before: 1949570 bytes
  - After: **1266413 bytes**
- feat: upgrade to napi-rs 2.2.0.

## [2.0.0-alpha.3] - 2022-03-01

### Added

- feat: add `.width` and `.height` to get the original size of the SVG.
- feat: add `toString()` to convert SVG shapes or text to path.

### Changed

- refactor: change to Class API, now instead use `new Resvg()` to create the constructor.

  With the new Class API, we can avoid rendering the SVG again when getting the SVG size. It also makes it easier to extend new APIs.

#### Before

```js
const { render } = require('@resvg/resvg-js')
const svg = '' // svg buffer or string
const pngData = render(svg, opts)
```

#### After

```js
const { Resvg } = require('@resvg/resvg-js')
const svg = '' // svg buffer or string
const resvg = new Resvg(svg, opts)
const pngData = resvg.render()

// New!
console.info('Simplified svg string \n', resvg.toString())
console.info('SVG original size:', `${resvg.width} x ${resvg.height}px`)
```

## [2.0.0-alpha.2] - 2022-02-21

### Added

- feat: upgrade resvg to [0.22.0](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0220---2022-02-20)

  Support `svg` referenced by `<use>`, this is often used in svg sprite.

  ```html
  <svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <svg id="svg1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
      <rect width="50%" height="50%" fill="green" />
    </svg>
    <use id="use1" x="50%" y="50%" xlink:href="#svg1" />
  </svg>
  ```

- feat: upgrade fontdb to [0.9.0](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/fontdb/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#added), loading system fonts will become faster.

  There are many CJK fonts installed in my local OS, the test result is 2.5 times faster:

  - Before: `Loaded 1085 font faces in 860.447ms.`
  - After: `Loaded 1085 font faces in 339.665ms.`

## [2.0.0-alpha.1] - 2022-02-17

### Added

- feat: playground uses [unpkg.com's](https://unpkg.com/@resvg/resvg-wasm) online resources
  ```html
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@resvg/resvg-wasm@2.0.0-alpha.2/index.min.js"></script>
  ```
- feat: preload wasm in the playground
  ```html
  <link rel="preload" as="fetch" type="application/wasm" href="https://unpkg.com/@resvg/resvg-wasm/index_bg.wasm" />
  ```
- chore: upload wasm file to artifacts
  Switching from local to building in CI (Linux-x64-gnu) for `.wasm` files can reduce the file size a bit.

  - Local, Mac-x64-darwin: 1969225 bytes
  - CI, Linux-x64-gnu: 1949570 bytes

  After gzip compression, the `.wasm` file is only about 700kB.

## [2.0.0-alpha.0] - 2022-02-15

resvg-js now supports WebAssembly ðŸŽ‰ What can I do now?

- You can convert SVG to PNG in the browser or Web Worker
- We provide Playground for direct use: https://resvg-js.vercel.app

With WebAssembly, resvg-js gains broader cross-platform compatibility, all by loading only about 2MB of Wasm files. And, the API is consistent with the Node.js side.

The current version of Wasm does not support loading fonts, so please submit an issue if you have a request.

### Added

- feat: upgrading to napi-rs v2.
- feat: support Android armv7(@resvg/resvg-js-android-arm-eabi).

### Changed

- fix: default_font_family changed from Times New Roman to Arial.
  This is closer to the default rendering font in the browser.

## [1.1.0] - 2021-11-11

### Added

- feat: implement `renderAsync()` function. By @Brooooooklyn

  We have made a major upgrade to napi-rs, from v1 to 2.x alpha. This allows better support for asynchronous binding and automatic generation of TypeScript definitions. Now you can enjoy `async/await`.

  ```js
  const { renderAsync } = require('@resvg/resvg-js')

  async function main() {
    const pngData = await renderAsync(/* SVG string or buffer */)
  }
  ```

- feat: The input to the `render()` and `renderAsync()` functions supports buffer.
- feat: improved webpack support, no more need `@node-rs/helper` dependency.

  The `@node-rs/helper` is convenient to load native binary cross platform and cpu arch. But it's not friendly to [`webpack`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), [`vercel/nft`](https://github.com/vercel/nft) and [`vercel/ncc`](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) because the logic is too dynamic.

- feat: add `example/compare.js`.

### Changed

- fix: the default font no longer throws an error if it is not found, it changes to a warning.
- chore: benchmark adds tests for svg icons and other improvements.
- chore: upgrade Rust Edition to 2021.

## [1.0.4] - 2021-10-19

### Added

- feat: `background` option supports alpha channel, currently only supports [CSS Colors 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-3/#colorunits).

  CSS color parse depends on [svgtypes](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/svgtypes/commit/266ee2caff9bd6a75d9a63b6e9850554f6de87b4).

```js
render(svgString, {
  // Support
  background: 'rgba(77, 25, 230, .8)',
  background: 'rgb(77, 25, 230, .8)',
  background: 'rgba(77%, 25%, 230%, .8)',
  background: 'hsla(255, 80%, 50%, .8)',
  background: 'hsl(255, 80%, 50%, .8)',
  // Not support
  background: 'rgb(77 25 230 / 80%)',
  background: 'rgb(77 25 230 / .8)',
  background: 'hsl(255deg 80% 50% / 80%)',
})
```
