## [Unreleased]

## [2.0.1] - 2022-05-07

### Fixed

- fix: rebuild Wasm to solve the problem of not working in the browser

## [2.0.0] - 2022-04-30

resvg-js now supports WebAssembly. ðŸŽ‰

- You can convert SVG to PNG in the browser or Web Worker
- We provide Playground for direct use: https://resvg-js.vercel.app

With WebAssembly, resvg-js gains broader cross-platform compatibility, all by loading only about 1.2MB of Wasm files. And, the API is consistent with the Node.js side.

The current version of Wasm does not support loading fonts, so please submit an issue if you have a request.

### Added

- feat: support WebAssembly(wasm32 target) via wasm-bindgen (#51)
- feat: add [WebAssembly playground](https://resvg-js.vercel.app)
- feat: upgrade resvg to 0.21.0
- feat: upgrade to napi-rs 2.1.0 (#60)
- chore: improved error message when output PNG size is 0 (#58)
- doc: add Node.js and WebAssembly usage documentation (#63)

## [2.0.0-beta.0] - 2022-04-02

The resvg-js API is now largely stable.

### Changed

- feat: `render()` result as a new class

  `render()` now no longer returns the `Buffer` directly, you need to get the buffer via the new `render().asPng()`, also added `render().width` and `render().height` to return the size of the PNG.

## [2.0.0-alpha.6] - 2022-03-20

### Changed

- chore: add libc fields on linux platform packages

  On Linux, it is not possible to tell exactly what kind of C library a native modules depends on just by os/cpu, so yarn 3.2 and cnpm added libc fields to further distinguish this case. This avoids downloading both `gnu` and `musl` packages at the same time.

  Currently only [yarn 3.2+](https://github.com/yarnpkg/berry/pull/3981) and [cnpm](https://github.com/cnpm/npminstall/pull/387) are supported, the npm implementation is [still under discussion](https://github.com/npm/rfcs/pull/519).

## [2.0.0-alpha.5] - 2022-03-19

### Changed

- feat: rounding width / height, this will further improve [#61](https://github.com/yisibl/resvg-js/issues/61).

  Physical pixels cannot be decimal, and when SVG dimensions have decimals in them, the output PNG dimensions are rounded. This should be consistent when getting the PNG size through the width / height API.

## [2.0.0-alpha.4] - 2022-03-14

### Added

- feat: strip text features and reduce the size of the generated wasm file.
  - before: 1949570 bytes
  - after: 1266413 bytes
- feat: upgrade to napi-rs 2.2.0.

## [2.0.0-alpha.3] - 2022-03-01

### Added

- feat: add `.width` and `.height` to get the original size of the SVG.
- feat: add `toString()` to convert SVG shapes or text to path.

### Changed

- refactor: change to Class API, now instead use `new Resvg()` to create the constructor.

  With the new Class API, we can avoid rendering the SVG again when getting the SVG size. It also makes it easier to extend new APIs.

#### Before

```js
const { render } = require('@resvg/resvg-js')
const svg = '' // svg buffer or string
const pngData = render(svg, opts)
```

#### After

```js
const { Resvg } = require('@resvg/resvg-js')
const svg = '' // svg buffer or string
const resvg = new Resvg(svg, opts)
const pngData = resvg.render()

// New!
console.info('Simplified svg string \n', resvg.toString())
console.info('SVG original size:', `${resvg.width} x ${resvg.height}px`)
```

## [2.0.0-alpha.2] - 2022-02-21

### Added

- feat: upgrade resvg to [0.22.0](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/resvg/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#0220---2022-02-20)

  Support `svg` referenced by `<use>`, this is often used in svg sprite.

  ```html
  <svg viewBox="0 0 200 200" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink">
    <svg id="svg1" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
      <rect width="50%" height="50%" fill="green" />
    </svg>
    <use id="use1" x="50%" y="50%" xlink:href="#svg1" />
  </svg>
  ```

- feat: upgrade fontdb to [0.9.0](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/fontdb/blob/master/CHANGELOG.md#added), loading system fonts will become faster.

  There are many CJK fonts installed in my local OS, the test result is 2.5 times faster:

  - Before: `Loaded 1085 font faces in 860.447ms.`
  - After: `Loaded 1085 font faces in 339.665ms.`

## [2.0.0-alpha.1] - 2022-02-17

### Added

- feat: playground uses [unpkg.com's](https://unpkg.com/@resvg/resvg-wasm) online resources
  ```html
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/@resvg/resvg-wasm@2.0.0-alpha.2/index.min.js"></script>
  ```
- feat: preload wasm in the playground
  ```html
  <link rel="preload" as="fetch" type="application/wasm" href="https://unpkg.com/@resvg/resvg-wasm/index_bg.wasm" />
  ```
- chore: upload wasm file to artifacts
  Switching from local to building in CI (Linux-x64-gnu) for `.wasm` files can reduce the file size a bit.

  - Local, Mac-x64-darwin: 1969225 bytes
  - CI, Linux-x64-gnu: 1949570 bytes

  After gzip compression, the `.wasm` file is only about 700kB.

## [2.0.0-alpha.0] - 2022-02-15

resvg-js now supports WebAssembly ðŸŽ‰ What can I do now?

- You can convert SVG to PNG in the browser or Web Worker
- We provide Playground for direct use: https://resvg-js.vercel.app

With WebAssembly, resvg-js gains broader cross-platform compatibility, all by loading only about 2MB of Wasm files. And, the API is consistent with the Node.js side.

The current version of Wasm does not support loading fonts, so please submit an issue if you have a request.

### Added

- feat: support WebAssembly(wasm32 target) via wasm-bindgen (#51)
- feat: add [WebAssembly playground](https://resvg-js.vercel.app)
- feat: upgrade resvg to 0.21.0
- feat: upgrade to napi-rs 2.1.0 (#60)
- chore: improved error message when output PNG size is 0 (#58)
- doc: add Node.js and WebAssembly usage documentation (#63)

## [1.4.0] - 2022-01-24

### Added

feat: support for glibc 2.12(via zig-cc) (#50)

### Changed

- fix: handle lld not found (#46)
- fix: js-binding for android-arm64 and android-arm-eabi (#53)

## [1.3.0] - 2022-01-01

### Added

- feat: upgrade to resvg 0.20.0(tiny-skia to 0.6.2).
- chore: add oslllo-svg2 to the examples and bench.

## [1.2.0] - 2021-12-25

### Added

- feat: upgrading to napi-rs v2.
- feat: support Android armv7(@resvg/resvg-js-android-arm-eabi).

### Changed

- fix: default_font_family changed from Times New Roman to Arial.
  This is closer to the default rendering font in the browser.

## [1.1.0] - 2021-11-11

### Added

- feat: implement `renderAsync()` function. By @Brooooooklyn

  We have made a major upgrade to napi-rs, from v1 to 2.x alpha. This allows better support for asynchronous binding and automatic generation of TypeScript definitions. Now you can enjoy `async/await`.

  ```js
  const { renderAsync } = require('@resvg/resvg-js')

  async function main() {
    const pngData = await renderAsync(/* SVG string or buffer */)
  }
  ```

- feat: The input to the `render()` and `renderAsync()` functions supports buffer.
- feat: improved webpack support, no more need `@node-rs/helper` dependency.

  The `@node-rs/helper` is convenient to load native binary cross platform and cpu arch. But it's not friendly to [`webpack`](https://github.com/webpack/webpack), [`vercel/nft`](https://github.com/vercel/nft) and [`vercel/ncc`](https://github.com/vercel/ncc) because the logic is too dynamic.

- feat: add `example/compare.js`.

### Changed

- fix: the default font no longer throws an error if it is not found, it changes to a warning.
- chore: benchmark adds tests for svg icons and other improvements.
- chore: upgrade Rust Edition to 2021.

## [1.0.4] - 2021-10-19

### Added

- feat: `background` option supports alpha channel, currently only supports [CSS Colors 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-color-3/#colorunits).

  CSS color parse depends on [svgtypes](https://github.com/RazrFalcon/svgtypes/commit/266ee2caff9bd6a75d9a63b6e9850554f6de87b4).

```js
render(svgString, {
  // Support
  background: 'rgba(77, 25, 230, .8)',
  background: 'rgb(77, 25, 230, .8)',
  background: 'rgba(77%, 25%, 230%, .8)',
  background: 'hsla(255, 80%, 50%, .8)',
  background: 'hsl(255, 80%, 50%, .8)',
  // Not support
  background: 'rgb(77 25 230 / 80%)',
  background: 'rgb(77 25 230 / .8)',
  background: 'hsl(255deg 80% 50% / 80%)',
})
```

## [1.0.3] - 2021-10-15

- feat: update typescript types definition. @axelhzf

### Changed

- chore: provides a better error prompt when the options type is wrong

### Fixed

- fix: loaded font faces time changed from milliseconds to ms

### Removed

- fix: remove the `path` option because we never implemented it

## [1.0.2] - 2021-10-13

### Changed

- docs: add npm packages doc and npm badges for each platform
- chore: ci add ignored files and directories

## [1.0.1] - 2021-10-11

npm has malfunctioned, which caused this version to fail to install.

### Changed

- chore: remove FreeBSD support #5
- feat: update resvg to 0.19.0
